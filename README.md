# Winner of Campolindo AP Physics - 2 Contest

<b>Objective: Design, build and demonstrate a Flotation Vehicle made out of recycled materials that can transport a passenger across an Olympics-size swimming pool in the shortest time.</b>

CADs, Constraints, Simulations, and Derivations for the Boat Project in AP Physics 2.

<h1>1. Designing</h1>
<p>The initial phase in the project is the designing phase. 3D CAD models for potential ideas were developed.</p>

<b>Design 1</b>
<img src="design1.png">
The first design contained ideas for a bouyant container.
<ul>
<li>Materials: wood, plastic, rubber</li>
<li>Components: wood base, plastic bottles, balloons for additional floatation</li>
</ul>


<b>Design 2 <i>(Approved and Finalized)</i></b>
<img src="design2.png">
The second design is a basic raft.
<ul>
<li>Materials: wood/cardboard, styrofoam</li>
<li>Components: wood/cardboard base, wood/cardboard stool, styrofoam floatation device</li>
</ul>


<h1>2. Calculations</h1>

<b>Key:</b>

<code>Fb</code>: buoyant force

<code>Fg</code>: gravitational force

<code>œÅ</code>: fluid density

<code>V</code>: volume (volume of submerged solid and displaced liquid are equal)

<code>m</code>: mass

<code>g</code>: gravitational constant (~10m/s/s)



<code>Fb = Fg</code>

<code>Fb = œÅVg</code>

<code>Fg = mg</code>

<code>mg = œÅVg</code>

<code>m = œÅV</code>

<code>V = m/œÅ</code>

It is assumed that the total mass of the boat and person is 70kg.
This experiment is conducted in water with a density of about 1000kg/m^3.


<code>V = 70kg / 1000kg/m^3</code>

<code>V = 0.07m^3</code>


Styrofoam density = <code>50kg/m^3</code>

<code>œÅ = m / V</code>

<code>50kg/m^3 = m / 0.07m^3</code>

<code>m = 3.5kg</code>



Thus, a 3.5kg styrofoam payload is necessary to support 70kg.

In words:

<code>mass_of_styrofoam_payload = density_of_styrofoam * total_boat_mass / density_of_water</code>

<code>mass_of_styrofoam_payload = 50kg/m^3 * 70kg / 1000kg/m^3 = 3.5kg</code>


<h1>3. The Finished Product</h1>

<img src="boat.png">
The finished product resembled the selected design, although there are some differences. The styrofoam payload, when fully submerged, could float up to 70kg, as planned, without wetting the cardboard seat.



<img src="oar.png">
The oar was a bamboo kayak oar. The paddles are made out of cardboard wrapped in bubble wrap. It spanned a total of 2m.


<h1>4. Winning the Physics Contest</h1>

Our team won the competition as the fastest flotation device that made it across the length of the Campo swimming pool against 8 competing teams.


<h1>5. The Trophy</h1>

The coolest trophy ever üòé
